# Theta

Instagram tweak for jailbreak and sideload. Open Theta from the settings gear on the home feed, or by long-pressing the home tab.

Tested against Instagram **441.0.0**.

## Requirements

- [Theos](https://theos.dev) with `THEOS` set (for example `export THEOS=/opt/theos`)
- Theos `Xcode14.xctoolchain` at `$THEOS/toolchain/Xcode14.xctoolchain`
- The **patched iPhoneOS 14.5 SDK** from this repo (see below). A stock Xcode SDK will not work — Theta is built with `SDKVERSION = 14.5` and needs Theos-patched private-framework stubs.
- Python 3 (used by `scripts/assemble.py` during the build)
- A Mac with Xcode command-line tools

Jailbreak packages also need **Cydia Substrate** on the device (`Depends: mobilesubstrate`). Sideload builds bundle Substrate into the IPA.

### Patched iPhoneOS 14.5 SDK

After cloning or forking, unpack the SDK into your Theos `sdks` directory:

```sh
mkdir -p "$THEOS/sdks"
tar -xJf sdks/iPhoneOS14.5.sdk.tar.xz -C "$THEOS/sdks"
```

That creates `$THEOS/sdks/iPhoneOS14.5.sdk`. Do not unpack it inside the Theta repo; Theos only looks under `$THEOS/sdks`.

## Build

Prefer `./build.sh` from the repo root. Do not set `SIDELOAD` and `ROOTLESS` at the same time.

```sh
./build.sh              # rootful .deb → packages/
./build.sh rootless     # rootless .deb → packages/
./build.sh sideload     # inject into input/Payload → output/Instagram_patched.ipa
```

Equivalent Make invocations:

```sh
make package
make package ROOTLESS=1
make package SIDELOAD=1
```

FFmpeg headers and frameworks live at `layout/Library/Application Support/ffmpeg.framework`. Sideload builds copy that framework into the app when it is present. Reel save still works without FFmpeg via a native AVFoundation fallback.

## Install

### Jailbreak (rootful / rootless)

1. Build with `./build.sh` or `./build.sh rootless`.
2. Copy the `.deb` from `packages/` to the device and install it with Sileo, Zebra, or `dpkg -i`.
   - Rootful: `packages/com.theta.tweak_1.0.1_iphoneos-arm.deb`
   - Rootless: `packages/com.theta.tweak_1.0.1_iphoneos-arm64.deb`
3. Respring if the package manager does not, then open Instagram.

If Theos device install is already configured (`THEOS_DEVICE_IP`), `make install` / `make install ROOTLESS=1` will install and reopen Instagram.

### Sideload

1. Get a **decrypted** Instagram IPA and unpack it so the app binary is at:

   ```
   input/Payload/Instagram.app/Instagram
   ```

   Example:

   ```sh
   unzip Instagram.ipa -d /tmp/ig
   mkdir -p input
   cp -R /tmp/ig/Payload input/
   ```

2. Run `./build.sh sideload`. That compiles `Theta.dylib` with `SIDELOAD=1`, injects it into the Instagram binary, stages `CydiaSubstrate.framework`, and writes `output/Instagram_patched.ipa`.

3. Install that IPA:
   - **Sideloadly / AltStore / SideStore** — open `output/Instagram_patched.ipa` and let the tool re-sign it with your Apple ID.
   - **TrollStore** — install the IPA on-device.

4. Open Instagram. Theta settings use the same gear / home-tab long-press as jailbreak.

If Substrate cannot be found automatically, set `SUBSTRATE_FRAMEWORK_PATH` to a `CydiaSubstrate.framework` directory, or place one at `third_party/CydiaSubstrate.framework`.

Sideload also injects `ThetaNSE` into Instagram’s notification service extension so decrypted banners can work. `Source/SideloadNSE/keychain-sharing.plist` is **optional** and is not applied by the build. Skip it unless notifications break because the extension cannot read Instagram’s keychain. In that case, merge those entitlements onto `Instagram.app` and `InstagramNotificationExtension.appex` only (never onto `ThetaNSE` or other dylibs), and replace `TEAMID` with your signing Team ID. Theta already probes wildcard keychain groups at runtime, so most sideload installs do not need this plist.

## Known issues

| Area | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Navigation** (Tab Icon Order, Swipe Between Tabs, Launch Tab, Hide Feed/Explore/Reels/Messages Tab, Messenger Mode) | **Sideload only** | Broken |

Jailbreak Navigation settings are unaffected. Everything else in Theta settings is expected to work on both jailbreak and sideload.
